Step1: Edit the initial settings in the tf.FLAG: 
       # The most important ones:
         a)'init_num_class' should be changed from 1000 to 4000, then to 10000,Gradually add training nodes.
         b) Note the 'fintune' should be 'True' except the case of the first time training. 
         c) After the model initilized with the first 1000 nodes, we fintune from'finetune_ckpt_path'. This path maybe different depends the training stopped early or late.   
         d) 'seal_bg_dir' is the seal data with background path, which has Two-level directory, every dir consists of 50 augmented seal images. 'seal_simple_dir' which is the path for simple data.

Step2: Training WITHOUT 'siamese_loss' and WITHOUT 'data_aug_slight', and WITHOUT 'div_input'.
       Now we can train the model iteratively via run 'Python my_train.py'.
       a) Train the model with only 1000 classes with the following settings:
          [num_class:10000, init_num_class:1000, sia_and_softmax:Flase, fintune:False, learning_rate:1e-3]
       b) When the accuracy is alomost 100%(>98%) and the model will be saved automatically.
       c) We fintune with more init class num (i.e., 4000) under the following settings:
          [num_class:10000, init_num_class:4000, sia_and_softmax:Flase, fintune:True, finetune_ckpt_path:'./logs/model.ckpt-1000', learning_rate:1e-3]
       d) When the accuracy is alomost 100%(>98%) and the model will be saved automatically.
       e) We fintune as above steps.
       ...
       f) Finally, we active all 10,000 nodes and the accuracy with 10,000 classes can be above 98%.          
        
Step3: Training WITH 'siamese_loss' and WITH 'data_aug_slight', and WITHOUT 'div_input'.
       Now we can train the model with siamese, which will be fintuned from above well trained 10,000-class model!
       a) Edit 'sia_and_softmax' and data_aug_slight' to 'True'.
       b) Train the model, until the sia-loss is around 2.0 and train_acc is round 90%.

Step4: Training WITH 'siamese_loss' and WITH 'data_aug_slight' and WITH 'div_input'.
       Now we can train the model with div_input, add seal simple data and random input, as to improve model performance.
       a) Edit 'div_input' to 'True'.
       b) Train the model with 1e-3 learning_rate , until the model train_acc is ropund 96%.
       
Step5: Drop the 'learning_rate' to '1e-4'.
       Train the model until the accuracy to roughly 99%.
